# Web Scraping and Analysis of iPhone Prices on Flipkart

## Overview
This project involves scraping data about iPhones from the e-commerce website Flipkart, analyzing the data, and visualizing the results. The primary goal is to understand the pricing trends of different iPhone models and colors.

## Tools Used
- **Python:** The project is implemented in Python due to its extensive library support and ease of use for web scraping and data analysis.
- **Selenium:** Selenium is used for automating the web browser to scrape data from the Flipkart website.
- **Pandas:** Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** These libraries are used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Implementation

### Data Collection
The data is collected from Flipkart's website. The script navigates through the pages of search results for "apple phones". For each phone listed, the script collects the following details:
- Title (Model)
- Color
- Price
- Rating
- Offer

The data is stored in lists, which are then used to create a pandas DataFrame.

### Data Cleaning
The collected data is cleaned by converting the price, offer, and rating values to appropriate data types (integers or floats). Any missing values are handled appropriately.

### Data Analysis
The cleaned data is analyzed to find the average price of iPhones by color. The groupby function in pandas is used to group the data by color and calculate the mean price.

### Data Visualization
The results of the analysis are visualized using a bar plot, which shows the average price of iPhones for each color.

## Findings
The analysis reveals that the Titanium color is the most expensive among iPhones.

## Future Work
This project can be extended in several ways:
- Analyzing more factors: Other factors such as storage capacity, screen size, etc., can also be considered in the analysis.
- Tracking price changes over time: The script can be run periodically to track changes in iPhone prices over time.
- Comparing with other brands: The same analysis can be done for other phone brands to compare their pricing trends with iPhones.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how web scraping, data analysis, and visualization can be used to gain insights into product pricing on e-commerce websites. The findings can be useful for both consumers looking to buy iPhones and sellers looking to understand the market better.
